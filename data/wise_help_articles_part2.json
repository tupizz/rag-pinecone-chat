This can take up to 5 working days (sometimes longer).

The most common cancellation reasons include:\n\nMoney sent without setting up a transfer first: If you send money to one of our bank accounts without setting up a transfer first, we won't know what to do with it. The funds are typically added to the user's Wise balance (AutoCredit) or refunded to the originating account (AutoRefund).\n\nUnpaid transfers: If a transfer isn't paid within approximately two weeks, it's automatically cancelled. Users must set up a new transfer, though the original exchange rate guarantee expires.\n\nRequested information not provided: When Wise needs additional documentation like ID copies or transfer details for regulatory compliance, they allow 2 working days for response before cancelling and refunding the transfer.\n\nPolicy violations: Transfers violating Wise's Customer Agreement are cancelled, and accounts may be closed.\n\nIncorrect recipient details: If the recipient's bank details contain errors, the recipient's bank rejects payment. Users can either correct the details for resubmission or request a full refund within 2 working days.\n\nRecipient bank rejection: Even with correct details, a recipient's bank may reject payment for reasons only they can clarify.\n\nFirst step: Check your email inbox and spam folder for notification messages explaining the specific cancellation reason.",

When customers cancel transfers, some operational costs still occur, but the transfer fee is no longer collected.\n\nIf cancellations become frequent, Wise may need to increase fees to compensate for this revenue gap. Conversely, when cancellations decrease, the company can potentially pass savings to customers through lower fees.\n\nAdditional Consequences of Frequent Cancellations: Cancelling too often also results in losing access to guaranteed rates, meaning customers receive the live exchange rate when money arrives rather than a locked-in rate.\n\nHow to Avoid Cancellations: Users can prevent cancellations by:\n- Adding a currency to their Wise account and converting funds at any time, instantly — and depending on the currencies you're sending between, it usually costs less\n- Setting up Auto Conversions to automatically exchange money when desired exchange rates are reached\n\nThe company notes that cancelling is acceptable when something went wrong, but customers should avoid making it a habit.",

As of September 2024, customers trust Wise with approximately 14.7 billion GBP.\n\nKey Protection Methods: Wise maintains customer funds through three approaches: cash holdings, secure liquid assets, or comparable guarantees. Unlike banks, Wise doesn't lend out customer money. Instead, the company uses \"safeguarding\"—keeping funds separate from operational assets.\n\nAsset Allocation: Most of your money is in secure liquid assets — such as EU, UK and US Government bonds, and money market funds. The bonds held are primarily short-term, with average duration under 6 months and most bonds maturing within 3 months or less. This strategy protects against interest rate risks and ensures liquidity.\n\nWhy This Approach: Government bonds are lower-risk than bank deposits because stable governments rarely default. By diversifying across multiple reputable banks and government securities, Wise maintains accessibility during market disruptions.\n\nRegional Variations: Protection methods differ by country. UK customers are covered under Wise Payments Ltd's safeguarding framework, while EU, US, Japan, and Brazil customers have entity-specific protections tailored to local regulations.\n\nWise operates under oversight from regulators including the FCA (UK), National Bank of Belgium (EU), and FinCEN (US).",
