      "text": "Question: My Wise card was lost or stolen\n\nAnswer: The article provides two main options when your Wise card is lost or stolen:\n\nFreezing Your Card:\nYou can instantly freeze your card from the Cards tab in your account to prevent unauthorized use. Pending transactions will still process. This is recommended if you expect to find the card soon, want to investigate suspicious charges, or plan temporary non-use.\n\nReplacing Your Card:\nYou can permanently replace your card, which blocks the old one with no option to unblock it. Replacement takes 2-21 days depending on your region. This is recommended if the card was stolen, damaged, lost permanently, or left in a public place where details could be copied.\n\nReporting Unauthorized Transactions:\nYou must immediately report unrecognized transactions through Wise's dispute reporting form at wise.com/dispute. If you cannot log in, contact support right away.",
